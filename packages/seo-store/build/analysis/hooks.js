/**
 * Analyzes whenever data changes.
 *
 * Which data is being watched?
 * - Paper data
 * - Keyphrases and synonyms
 * - Analysis on-the-fly configuration
 * - Editor data: as this is the common source of replacevars
 *
 * A choice has been made here to not apply the replacevars in the paper data yet.
 * Instead, the editor data is being watched. This should be expanded to all relevant state being kept in this store.
 * When implementers add replacevars with sources outside of this store, they are responsible for calling analyze for themselves.
 * The positive here is that this does not rely on outside data calls (which the replacevars can be/are).
 *
 * @param {number} debounceTimeInMs Amount of millisecond to debounce for.
 *
 * @returns {void}
